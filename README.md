As part of my exchange with the University of Montreal , I wrote, in
collaboration with Pierre Turlan, a paper on subliminal channels
(supervised by Stefan Wolf). Most of my work was focused on the DSA
algorithm. The project includes a practical implemenation of
subliminal channel in DSA.

The main idea of the project is to produce software capable of
producing perfectly valid DSA signatures although in fact each
signature reveals the signer's private key! This illustrates the
necessitated use to open source cryptographic software because it
makes no sense to trust a software simply because it seems to work
correctly. It is necessary that the sources are checked to prevent
mistakes as well as fraud.

The [documentation](docs/) contains more explanations and references
are found in the [project paper](docs/rapport.pdf) (in French).
